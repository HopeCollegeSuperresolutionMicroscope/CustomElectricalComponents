#About

For the chosen stepper motor from Oriental Motor LLC, a driver is required that must be communicated
with via RS485 protocol.  In order to interface such communication with micro-manager on a PC,
a USB To RS485 adapter must be purchased.

The documentation pertaining to this particular adapter is in regards to the recommended adapter
by Oriental Motor.  Please note, Oriental Motor requires a custom wiring of Ethernet wires into
the adapter.  DO NOT order adapters that are simply listed as USB to RS-485, as Oriental Motor
uses a non-standard wire configuration into their units.  

The appropriate instructions for assembling an RS-485 Adapter with an ethernet cable can be found
in the Schematics Folder.

    Necessary tools: 

		Miniature flat-head screw driver
		Wire Stripper
		Fine Wire Stripper (for stripping the ethernet wires)

See the Documentation and datasheets.

In regards to the driver written for the Autofocus motor at the other end, it must be noted
that the driver IS NOT adapter agnostic.  It makes use of the FTDI USB chip and drivers.  If may
be possible to use another adapter, but one must make certain that it is an FTDI based adapter.
