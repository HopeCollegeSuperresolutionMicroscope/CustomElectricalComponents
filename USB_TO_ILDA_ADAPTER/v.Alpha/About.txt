#Version Alpha
#About.txt

The first prototype that was used to maintain a stable control over the PRO-1600RGB laser from 
Laserworld.  This prototype is what was used to do primary testing and proof of this system as
integrated into uManager microscopy setup software.  It, however, implements an erroneous reading
of the ILDA standard and as such is not guaranteed to work with all ILDA IO pins.

As such, this alpha version stands as proof of control of the PRO-1600RGB and may be tested against 
other ILDA laser boxes if so desired to ensure performance. 

Schematic:

    The schematic makes use of a Deprected switch (see schematic itself for details).  This switch
will become a production chokepoint.  Efforts to formalize and proof v1.0 move toward this.

PCB:

   The alpha prototype exists in a breadboarded state in the setup this lab tested against.  As such,
there are no Gerber files at this moment.  It is seen as a better use of time to work on proving
the v1.0 PCB instead.  The following version however will require a reworking of uManager Device 
Library code to accomodate an increase in IO if that is desired.

Software

    C++ code was written as a .dll on Micro-manager for the alpha version explicitly.  In order to 
test the setup this lab used.
