This is the follow-up theoretical designed controller for compliance with the ILDA IO standard.  This
standard requires differential signals at the inputs and it's lack of firm discussion on pin sinking
require a more robust account for potential "operational signal" current draw.

Additionally, DAC power is supplied via wall power with regulators, in order to reduce fluctuations
in voltage that can occur by overloading the load on a set of USB buses for a computer. 

Schematic:

    The schematic is done in theory, but may need revisions upon breadboarding or pcb testing in an 
actual setup.

PCB:

   The PCB has not yet been arranged nor has a breadboard been proven yet.  A finalized Gerber file
should be introduced after a successful iteration and testing.

Software

    C++ code was written as a .dll on Micro-manager for the alpha version explicitly. The Version 1
attempts to implement the same USB bridge triggers so that there is no need to change the .dll for
the sake of changing hardware.

Further expansions to the other optional ILDA pins may be achieved in a future iteration with adjustments 
to the .dll.
